hello , i would like to apologise again for this, and how my work is being submitted , this is not normally how unprofessional i am, 
i have tried for 50+ hours and done trial and error with this project, i was so proud of my first game.
however as i went to send, my files corrupted and i cant even open my project in unity anymore. However i am submitting what i can.

 unity-fpc.unitypackage Asset pack I downloaded, i used some of the assets in different ways to shape the levels i made.

The FPS cam I used the script from the Seminar but I modified it so it was more tailored to the levels.
